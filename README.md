The code is meant to solve the SRG flux equation for the Triton Hamiltonian in the No-Core Shell model and study the ground state of the system as the flux parameter evolves.

Compile main.py with Python 3 to start the program.

As the program runs, multiple subfolders can be created to store the results.

The 'Multiplot&Analysis' contains stuff I used to make the report.

The code does not provide the solution to the SRG applied to a realistic potential, even if it is included in the report, so it should not be considered part of the numerical project.
